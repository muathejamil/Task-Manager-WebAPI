# Task Manager WebAPI

## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Manager WebAPI project. This project is a WebAPI project that allows users to manage their tasks. The application was built using the ASP.NET Core framework and utilizes a RESTful API. I have also implemented token-based authentication and authorization to ensure the security of the user's data.

## Clean Architecture

In this project, I have followed the clean architecture model. This architecture model is a way of organizing the code into separate layers, where each layer has a specific purpose and responsibility. It helps to maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to maintain and test the application.

- FluentValidation
- CsvHelper

## Running the Project

Once you've cloned the project to your local machine, update the connection string to match your setup. Next, use the register API to create a new account. This API will provide you with a token that you will use to access the task controller.
